## üëã About Me

**OPEN TO POSTDOCS/POSITIONS** (Starting JAN 2026)

I am a **Research Associate at ISTI-CNR, Pisa**, working on deep learning solutions for critical challenges like **data scarcity**, **data quality**, and **class imbalance** in Earth Observation and computer vision domains. I specialize in SAR-based maritime surveillance, image super-resolution, and curriculum learning. With a passion for AI and sustainability, I aim to bridge research with real-world applications.
